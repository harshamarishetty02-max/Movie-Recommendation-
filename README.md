# Movie-Recommendation-
## 🔹 Project Overview
This project builds a **Recommendation System** that suggests movies to users based on their interests.  
It uses collaborative filtering and/or content-based techniques to enhance personalized recommendations.

## 🔹 Dataset
- Source: [MovieLens / Kaggle Dataset]  
- Features: User ID, Movie ID, Ratings, Genres, etc.  

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Surprise / LightFM (if used)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit / Flask (for app, if built)

## 🔹 Approaches Implemented
1. **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends similar movies based on genres & features.  
2. **Collaborative Filtering** – recommends movies based on user ratings (user-user or item-item similarity).  
3. **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** – advanced recommendation model.  

## 🔹 Results
- Provided top-N recommendations for each user.  
- Improved recommendation accuracy (RMSE: XX).  

## 🔹 How to Run
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/movie_recommendation.ipynb
